      "summary": "I am the author of the forthcoming book, What Millennials Want (Penguin Random House), an intimate biography of Indian millennials, the world’s single-largest demographic group. \nI traveled more than 30,000 kilometers across 13 Indian states to interview more than 900 millennials, educators, business leaders, and policymakers to investigate the economic aspirations, social views, and political attitudes of young India. \nI have contributed op-eds to The Washington Post, The Times of India, Mint, Firstpost, and The Print, and have been featured in the Financial Times and The Guardian. \nI truly believe that young people in India have been left out of the political and social discourse, and I hope to change and challenge that with my writing and research. My book will be published in 2021."
